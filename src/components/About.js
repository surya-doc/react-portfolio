            <p>Hello, my name is Surya Dana. I am a web developer and a competitive coder. I started my programming journey in my college. Though it sounds late, my interest and hard work make me familiar with it in just a few months. I started with C and then learn C++. In my second semester, I started learning web development and found it very interesting, so I choose to continue with it. After learning the frontend part I started the backend with node. Creating new projects with new technologies always attracts me.</p>
